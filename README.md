# 🛠️ life-automation-scripts

Scripts I wrote to make life easier (or just weirder).  
Mostly random automation stuff — from daily tasks to "why not?" experiments.

## ⚡ What’s in the Repo?

- 🧠 Brain-off scripts I run daily
- 💻 Terminal automations to boost workflow
- 📂 Folder orgs, file renamers, cleanup hacks
- 🌐 Web stuff — scraping, auto-login, dumb bots
- 🤖 AI tools & weird LLM uses

> Basically, anything I got too lazy to do manually — it goes here.

---

## 🧪 Why?

Because automating small stuff adds up.  
Also... I was bored. And I hate repetition.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- Use at your own risk.
- Don’t blindly run anything — read the code first.
- If it breaks your system, that’s a skill issue 🫠

## 🚀 How to Use
